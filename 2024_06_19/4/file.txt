In, the linked loop code (LLC) is presented as a promising code for the unsourced A-channel with erasures (UACE).
The UACE is an unsourced multiple access channel in which active users' transmitted symbols are erased with a given
probability and the channel output is obtained as the union of the non-erased symbols. In this paper, we extend the
UACE channel model to the unsourced B-channel with erasures (UBCE). The UBCE differs from the UACE in that the channel
output is the multiset union, or bag union, of the non-erased input symbols. In other words, the UBCE preserves the symbol multiplicity of the channel output while the UACE does not.
Both the UACE and UBCE find applications in modeling aspects of unsourced random access. The LLC from is enhanced and shown to outperform the tree code over the UBCE.
Findings are supported by numerical simulations.
